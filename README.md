# Technical Build Overview

<a id="serverless-functions-for-sensitive-api-calls"></a>

## Serverless Functions for Sensitive API Calls

- **Deployment Platform:**
  - Netlify
- **Purpose:**
  - To securely make API calls to OpenAI's API, we utilized serverless functions deployed on Netlify. This approach enhances security by keeping sensitive API keys server-side and off the client-side code, thereby reducing exposure to potential vulnerabilities.

<a id="user-registration-and-login"></a>

## User Registration and Login

- **Back End Framework:**
  - Django REST Framework (DRF) hosted on Heroku
- **Functionality:**
  - We implemented user registration and login functionality using Django DRF, providing a secure and efficient way for users to access their accounts. The Django user model is extended to support custom user data and authentication mechanisms.

<a id="data-models"></a>

## Data Models

- **User Model:**
  - Utilizes the standard Django user model for authentication and user management.
- **Account Model:**
  - Designed to store user profile information with a focus on future scalability for incorporating social media activities. It includes owner-specific permissions for update and delete operations, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Partner Profile Model:**
  - Aims to store partner characteristics, simplifying the user experience by eliminating the need to fill out forms on each login. This model enhances the platform's usability by allowing registered users to quickly access relevant information.

<a id="agile-approach-to-development"></a>

# Agile Approach to Development

Due to time constraints and the ambitious scope of our project, we adopted an agile development approach, prioritizing specific features to ensure timely and effective delivery. Here's a brief overview of our development phases:

1. **Initial Focus:**

- Development began with the implementation of serverless functions on Netlify for secure OpenAI API calls, alongside the construction of the React front end and backend Django API authentication.

2. **Integration and Testing:**

- Once the OpenAI API functionality was developed and tested, it was integrated into the main React application. Concurrently, front end developers worked on styling, while back end developers focused on the account model for profile data storage.

3. **User Authentication:**

- The registration and login functionalities were implemented, allowing users to securely access their accounts. This phase also included front end enhancements for usability and aesthetics, alongside backend development for partner data storage.

4. **User Profile and Partner Info:**

- Time-permitting, additional features such as user profile management (CRU operations) and partner information storage with CRUD capabilities were planned to enrich the user experience and platform functionality.

Our agile approach ensured that we remained flexible and responsive to project needs, allowing for the prioritization of critical features while laying the groundwork for future enhancements.
